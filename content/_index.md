      title: Secure Guest Wi‑Fi Without the Marketing Hooks.
      description: |
         Captivi keeps your network fast, private, and hassle-free by giving Wi‑Fi access only to paying customers — using your existing Square POS and UniFi gear.
         
         **No signups. No social logins. No staff tech support required.**

      description: |
         Some captive integration systems turn your customers into marketing leads. _Captivi doesn’t_. Instead, we strive to keep your Wi‑Fi clean, simple, and secure — granting access only to verified paying customers.

         **No personal info forms, no promo emails, no staff handing out passwords.**

         Just fast, branded Wi‑Fi that works — backed by network experts who keep things running smoothly behind the scenes.

               Captivi made our café WiFi effortless. We just print the receipt, and guests connect. No more headaches, just happy customers!

               Our guest network used to be a mess—now it's secure, staff-only, or guest with purchase. Captivi handled the setup and it just works.

               The amount of staff hours we spent helping our customers get online was staggering. Captivi virtually eliminated that.
