    title: Built for Small Businesses Who Deserve Better Wi‑Fi (and Better Networks)
    description: |
      Captivi was created after talking with coffee shop owners, brewery managers, and others in the hospitality space — people who were tired of resetting Wi‑Fi passwords, dealing with staff questions, or paying for features they’d never use.

      So we built something simple: secure guest Wi‑Fi that just works — backed by world class cloud components, and real support, no marketing fluff.

    title: Why Captivi?
    description: |
      Most captive portals today focus on lead generation-and that's OK. But... they ask your guests for phone numbers, email addresses, or other information that -at best- slows the experience down and causes friction. That data is then turned around and positioned for marketingor resale. That’s not always what you signed up for.
      
      Captivi does the opposite. We focus on network quality, staff safety, and customer experience.
      
      _We realize that sometimes you are looking for a lead-generation platform, and if that's the case we're happy to recommend some amazing products (that aren't Captivi). Satisfaction with your network is one of our core tenants, and we know that doesn't always mean it's with us!_
