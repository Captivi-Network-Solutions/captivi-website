    description: We're always here to help. Here are the most frequently asked questions.
    faq:
      - title: Does Captivi work with any WiFi system?
        description: Captivi is built specifically for Ubiquiti UniFi networks. We may already work with other platforms or could expand in the future—contact us if you have questions!
      - title: How does the Square integration work?
        description: Captivi verifies guest WiFi access by checking for a valid Square receipt code and order total. You control the rules—such as how long access is granted and bandwidth limits.
      - title: Is guest data safe and private?
        description: >-
          Yes! Captivi only verifies purchase and device information for the purposes of connecting to Wi-Fi. We don’t store or sell guest browsing data.
      - title: Can I customize the captive portal?
        description: Absolutely. We provide a basic template but you can (and should) add your own logo, colors, and messaging for a seamless guest experience across 1 or 100 (or more) locations.
      - title: What support is included?
        description: All maintenance plans include transparent remote updates, email support, and rapid response to outages. Proactive and reactive network monitoring is included at our Premium level, for care that goes beyond the guest Wi-Fi experience. Phone and onsite support is available by request for an additional fee (varies based on request-ask us for a price list).
      - title: What if I need a network upgrade?
        description: Our team can help design, upgrade, or troubleshoot your UniFi environment—see our Network Design Services above.
      - title: What forms of payment do you accept?
        description: We accept credit cards, checks, and cash.
      - title: In which currencies can I make payments?
        description: All payments are in **USD**.
