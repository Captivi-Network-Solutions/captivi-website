    description: We're always here to help. Here are the most frequently asked questions.
    faq:
      - title: Does Captivi work with any WiFi system?
        description: Captivi is built specifically for Ubiquiti UniFi networks. We may already work with other platforms or could expand in the future—contact us if you have questions!
      - title: How does the Square integration work?
        description: Captivi verifies guest WiFi access by checking for a valid Square receipt code and order total. You control other rules—such as how long access is granted and bandwidth limits.
      - title: Is guest data safe and private?
        description: >-
          Yes. Captivi is designed around privacy and security. We verify a receipt and device ID — that’s it. No browsing data is collected, stored, or sold. Ever.
      - title: Can I customize the captive portal?
        description: Absolutely. We provide a basic template but you control your branding — logo, colors, and messages — across all locations. Captivi ensures your brand is what customers see (not ours).
      - title: What support is included?
        description: Every Captivi plan includes email support and automatic cloud-based remote updates. Premium plans add proactive UniFi monitoring, improved response-time SLAs, and network consulting. Need more? Phone or on-site support is available by request — just ask and we’ll tailor a quote.
      - title: What if I need a network upgrade?
        description: Our team can help design, upgrade, or troubleshoot your environment. We offer expert guidance and hands-on help for UniFi upgrades, VLAN design, access point placement, firewall tuning, and more.
      - title: What forms of payment do you accept?
        description: We accept credit cards, checks, and cash.
      - title: In which currencies can I make payments?
        description: All payments are in **USD**.
